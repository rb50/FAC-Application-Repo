# My First Website

https://rb50.github.io/

This is the first website I made as part of my application for Founders and Coders. It was built using HTML CSS and Javascript, without using any libraries. 

I created the HTML structure by using sequential `<div>` elements which allowed me to split the page into various sections, and then styling various individual elements separately.

## Key Lessons

* I used media queries to ensure that the website was responsive to different screen sizes. The website therefore is responsive to different desktop sizes. 

* I used Javascript to include changing images in the inital section of the page, and keyframes within the CSS ensured that the images faded in and out to give a smoother transition.
